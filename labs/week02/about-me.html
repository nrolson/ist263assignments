            <h1> Nolan Olson - About Me </h1>
            <br>
            <p> Hi, my name is Nolan, a senior at Syracuse with an IM&T major with a PC minor. I grew up in north/central Jersey 
                (depends if you belive central Jersey exists), and I plan on living in the tri-state area for the rest of my life. 
                My plan after college is to start at the dealership level and work my way up to corperate in the automotive industy.</p>
            <br>
            <p> At the more personal level, I have two dogs (English Bulldogs) who are my favorite two beings on the planet. I'm also a 
                massive automotive entusiast, I love everything about the industry which is why I'm persuing a career in it. Out of every brand,
            Land Rover is my favorite because no other company has been able to combine serious off-road capability and uncompromised luxury
        like Land Rover. Currently I drive a 2007 Acura TSX (6-speed manual) but I plan to buy a Range Rover Classic (1990-1993) once I graduate. </p>
