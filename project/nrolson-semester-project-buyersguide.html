                    <p style= "text-align: center; color: white;">As with any car, you need to know what to look out for when buying your X308. Being a Jaguar, there are some specific problem areas that need to be avoided</p>

                            <h3>Timing Chain Guides</h3>
                                <p>The most common failular with the X308 are the plastic timing chain guides. They degrade over time and snap which upsets the timing and can possibly seize your engine. There was a technical service bulletin released to fix the issue with metal guides but not all X308s were fixed. Confirm with the owner that this was addressed. 2002.5 to 2003 models came with the upgraded metal guides so this is not a concern.</p>
                            <h3>Nikasil Cylinder Liners</h3>
                                <p>A problem the X308 shared with BMWs of the period were nikasil liners that reacted with sulpherous fuel and degraded, siezing the engine. This issue affected 1998-1999 model years. Some engines were replaced under warranty but confrim with a Jaguar dealership that this was performed.</p>

                            <h3>Complete failular</h3>
                                <p>The worst problem with X308s was their sealed for life ZF transmissions. All, ALL will fail eventually. Some people are able to modify the transmission with a drain pug that allows for fluid changes which helps but this is not commonly done. Most likely, an X308 that you'd be looking at will not have this modification so consider doing it once you purchase your X308. Luckily for XJR and Super V8 owners, the superchanged engine was mated exclusivey to a reliable Mercedes-Benz 5-speed transmission.</p>

                            <h3>Rust</h3>
                                <p>The X308 is well rust-proofed since Ford made huge chages to the factory that upped anti-corosion efforts. Even so, there are still some areas where rust can surface. The lower rear wheel arches can sometimes start to rot, check the fronts as well. Under the hood, the seal clossest to the occupant compartment spans the width of the car but stops short on either side leaving an exposed metal groove. The edges of these grooves always rust but they're easy to repair.</p>
