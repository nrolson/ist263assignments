            <h1> Project Idea Statement </h1>
            <br>
            <p> My website will be a guide to the 6th generation of the Jaguar XJ, the X308 XJ8 that spanned from 1998-2003. 
                The website will show the different trim levels and options for each model year, discuss changes and updates 
                that were made throughout its lifespan, talk about common issues, and give the history of the development of the model. 
                The purpose of the page will be to educate people who interested in buying an X308 or enthusiasts who want to learn more.</p>
