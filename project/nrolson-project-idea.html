            <h1> Project Idea Statement </h1>
            <br>
            <p> My website will be a guide to the 6th generation of the Jaguar XJ, the X308 XJ8 that spanned from 1998-2003. 
                The website will show the different trim levels and options for each model year, discuss changes and updates 
                that were made throughout its lifespan, talk about common issues, and give the history of the development of the model. 
                The purpose of the page will be to educate people who interested in buying an X308 or enthusiasts who want to learn more.</p>

            <h1> Content Plan </h1>
            <br>
            <p> Pages:
                - Homepage
                    Includes a big heading, large images, and introductory body text.
                - "Timeline" page that takes you through each model year
                    Heavy use of lists and tables to organize the headings, body text, and images together for each year. Each model 
                    year will have its own section, demarcated by heading text.
                - Common faults and issues page
                    This page will be copy heavy and use headings and body text as such. Some paragraphs will be accompanied by images. 
                    Relevant videos will be imbedded, for example, a tutorial that solves an issue.
                - History page
                    Another copy-heavy page with headings and body text but block quotes will be added to highlight particularly interesting 
                    quotes or information. Some images will be added to break up the paragrahs.
                - Bio about how I became interested in the X308
                    Small page with some body text and an image.
                - Links to sites of interest
                    Headings with links below and some short,descriptive body text will make up most of the page.
                <br>
                Media wise, I'll use some of my pictures, pictures from the Wikimedia Commons, and royalty-free press photos provided by Jaguar. 
                Content will come from personal knowledge, Jaguar press releases, Jaguar guides, and information from experts within the 
                X308 community.
